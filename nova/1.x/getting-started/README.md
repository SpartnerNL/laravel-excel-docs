:rocket: Supercharge your Laravel Nova resource exports

- **Easily export resources to Excel.** Supercharge your Nova resources and export them directly to an Excel or CSV document. Exporting has never been so easy.

- **Supercharged resource exports.** Export resources with automatic chunking for better performance. You provide us the query, we handle the performance. Exporting even larger resources? No worries, Laravel Nova Excel has your back. You can queue your exports so all of this happens in the background.

- **Export based on filters and selection.** Select or filter only certain resources and export only those to Excel!

- **Export lenses.** Got custom lenses defined? When exporting from a lens, it will use the query of the lens to determine which data needs to be exported!
