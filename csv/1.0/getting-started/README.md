# Introduction

:rocket: Laravel Csv is intended to be a Laravel-flavoured League/Csv: a simple, but elegant wrapper around League/Csv with the goal of simplifying
large exports. 

:fire: [League/Csv](https://csv.thephpleague.com/) is designed for developers who want to deal with CSV data using modern code and without the high levels of bootstrap and low-levels of usefulness provided by existing core functions or third party-code.

**Laravel Csv Features:**

* Easily export collections to Csv.
* Export queries with automatic chunking for better performance.
* Queue exports for better performance.
* Download or store exports
