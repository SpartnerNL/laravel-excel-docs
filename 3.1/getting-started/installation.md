## Installation

Require this package in the `composer.json` of your Laravel project. This will download the package and _PhpSpreadsheet_.

```
composer require maatwebsite/excel:^3.1
```

If installing your receive the following error 

```
  Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires maatwebsite/excel 3.1 -> satisfiable by maatwebsite/excel[3.1.0].
    - maatwebsite/excel 3.1.0 requires php ^7.0 -> your php version (8.2.8) does not satisfy that requirement.
```

You can try simply to install without the caret

```
composer require maatwebsite/excel
```

If you don't get the latest version or run into more composer errors, please make sure you have installed all required PHP extensions like zip, gd, etc.

The `Maatwebsite\Excel\ExcelServiceProvider` is __auto-discovered__ and registered by default.

If you want to register it yourself, add the ServiceProvider in `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
    /*
     * Package Service Providers...
     */
    Maatwebsite\Excel\ExcelServiceProvider::class,
]
```

The `Excel` facade is also __auto-discovered__.

If you want to add it manually, add the Facade in `config/app.php`:

```php
'aliases' => [
    ...
    'Excel' => Maatwebsite\Excel\Facades\Excel::class,
]
```

To publish the config, run the vendor publish command:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Maatwebsite\Excel\ExcelServiceProvider" --tag=config
```

This will create a new config file named `config/excel.php`.
